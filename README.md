**Classification ( Only )**
Classification algorithms are used when you have a dataset of observations where we'd like to use the features associated with an observation to predict its class.

1. Logistic Regression ( 82.5 )
2. Naive Bayes ( 79.25 )

**Regression ( Only )**
Regression algorithms are used when you have a dataset of observations where you'd like to use the features to predict a continuous output.

1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Gaussian Process Regression

**Classification and Regression (Both)**

1. Support Vector Machines ( 92.40 % )
2. Random Forests (86.1 %)
3. Boosted Trees
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (71.28 %)
5. Decision Trees

Clustering (Only)
Clustering is a popular technique to find groups or segments in your data that are similar. This is an unsupervised learning algorithm in the sense that you don't train the algorithm and give it examples for what you'd like it to do, you just let the clustering algorithm explore the data and provide you with new insights.

1. K-means clustering
2. Soft clustering with Gaussian mixture models
3. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
